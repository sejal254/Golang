In Go, := is for declaration + assignment, whereas = is for assignment only.
for example 
var temp int=10 
is same as 
temp:=10



Difference between variable and constants
Constants are like variables, except they can't be modified once they have been declared.
Constants are useful for defining a value that will be used more than once in your program, but shouldn't be able to change.


Global/Local variables

package main
var g = global
func printlocal(){
     var l:=local
     fmt.Println(l)
}
func main(){
     printlocal()
     fmt.Println(g)
}

// Error: count variable doesn't have a data type
var count

// count1 is of the int type
var count1 int

// count2 is of the int type
var count2 = 10



// initial value
number := 10
fmt.println("Initial number value", number) // prints 10

// change variable value
number = 100
fmt.Println("The changed value", number)  // prints 100
