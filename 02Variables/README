In Go, := is for declaration + assignment, whereas = is for assignment only.
for example 
var temp int=10 
is same as 
temp:=10



Difference between variable and constants
Constants are like variables, except they can't be modified once they have been declared.
Constants are useful for defining a value that will be used more than once in your program, but shouldn't be able to change.
